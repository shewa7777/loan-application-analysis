## loan-application-analysis

This project involved exploring a loan application dataset using Python in Jupyter Notebook. The goal was to understand what factors influence loan approval decisions.

## Questions Answered:
- What are the key differences between approved and rejected applications?
- Do factors like income, credit history, and loan amount affect approval?
- Can we identify any patterns or trends in the data?

## What I Did:
- Cleaned the dataset and handled missing values
- Used visualizations to explore trends and compare groups
- Analyzed how different variables impact loan approval
- Built a basic regression model to support the findings

## Tools:
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook

This was a coursework project completed as part of my masterâ€™s in Business Analytics.
